			<h2>Depth first tree traversal</h2>

			<div style="margin:0 auto;width:80%">
				The depth first tree traversal has three different algorithms , namely:
				<ol>
					<li>In-order</li>
					<li>Post-order</li>
					<li>Pre-order</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>
					I will be discussing about the in-order algorithm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The in-order algorithm, using the binary tree as an example , visits the LEFT
					of the tree , the PARENT , and then the RIGHT of the tree.The in-order algorithm keeps visiting the left of the 
					tree recursively until it gets to a LEAF node(ie. node with no children ) or a node with no more LEFT of tree, 
					then it visits the parent node of that tree and then the RIGHT of tree.In a binary search tree , if the the in-order 
					depth first tree traversal is applied it will give a sorted list of numbers.
